"# trekson" 

This demo is adapted from the code provided in the YouTube tutorial [JSON CRASH COURSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI1CWzNtE-M) from [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/).  See the tutorial for details on how the code is built.

This project is expanding on the code provided, for constructing tables, lists and inline text from JSON data.  Just for fun, I'm using Star Trek stuff to populate the database.  There are some errors that need to be fixed. Can you spot them?  If you don't care about Star Trek, or (better) if you disagree with anything in the 'Favorite Episode' or 'Notes' objects.. change it and make your own!  Or do Game of Thrones.. or stamp collecting.. whatever!

There's no jquery or any other requirements; however, if you want the page to update without refreshing the page, you can install the Live Server from nodejs.  The command is *npm intall -g live-server* and sets up quickly.
